Hi! I am a computer science major and I will graduate in 2028! 

## My favorite labs

Lab 4
I really like this lab because we had to build up upon the shell command. I thought it was interesting how we had to use the shell commands in this lab. I found it challenging to make a program that would convert the measurements of volume from millimeters to units that are in the US customary system. Also I remember having to double the variable in order to store the number of millimeters. Overall I really enjoyed doing this lab.

Lab 7
I like how we used city streets in this lab. The way we wrote functions that would implement the parking restrictions was so fascinating. Also it's interesting how it could be used in a system to tell you where you can and cannot park. 

Lab 6
I liked this lab because we used mad libs, which I think are really fun. I enjoyed how we were able to use any words of our choice to fill in the blanks even if it didn’t really make sense. It was cool to watch how the first statement declared and initialized the command line.
